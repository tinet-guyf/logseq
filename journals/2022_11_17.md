	- **The passing of the real estate and debt problems through the financial system and into the bones of the economy.**
	- **COVID and COVID policies have weakened the economy and in some cases have led to some discontent. **
	- **What Chinese policy makers are doing with capitalism, tech companies, and common prosperity is having both direct and indirect adverse effects on markets and the economy.**
	- **The wars with the United States are having a negative effect on economic activity**
	- **The world economy is getting worse and inflation and tight monetary policies to fight it are bad for Chinese exports and Chinese capital inflows.**
	- **This environment of great controls and great risks is leading decision makers in all areas to be more inclined to not make decisions than to make decisions that could be perceived as bad ones. This is negative for growth and improvement.**
	- **Demographics are an exceptionally big financial and economic issue in China that is hurting growth in China—more so than in most countries—because of China’s culture in which adult children take care of their old parents. Because there is not an adequate healthcare and pension system in place, this creates a large economic and time burden on those in their 40s and 50s.**
	- **As has been true throughout the thousands of years of Chinese civilization, acts of nature—droughts, floods, and pandemics—are a major concern.**
